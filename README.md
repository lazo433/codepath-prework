## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

favorite apps include:

- Instagram 
    - ability to add music to Instagram stories
    - save Instagram posts
- Snapchat
    - filters
    - One time photos (snaps)
- Spotify
    - shuffle music 
    - lyrics feature

**App idea:** I want to create an app that tells you gas prices near you. With gas prices being high, you want to find the one place witht the lowest price. Features would include map of gas station with their prices, feature that allows user to favorite a gas station and tells you when prices drop.
